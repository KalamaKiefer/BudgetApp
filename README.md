React Bootstrap Budget App
- Created a budgeting web app that allows users to add budget limits, expenses, and track totals.
- Used React context to pass props to children such as the budgets and expenses. 
- Created a custom hook to utilize local storage to store budgets and expenses array and useEffect hook to update values whenever changed. Utilized uuid library to create ID values for budgets and expenses.
- App uses React Bootstrap for a clean, minimal UI design using bootstrap classes and components(Cards, Buttons, Modal, Form...etc)
